## Advanced Lane Detection

### Description
Advanced Lane Detection is a Python program to detect lanes and highlight the lane area. ALD composes of various existing computer vision techniques present in OpenCV to process each frame in a video to detect the lanes. ALD was inspired and in many ways is based on the Advanced Lane Lines project from Udacity's Self Driving Car ND Program. 

### Documentation
#### Project Directory
**build:** The main project directory. The heart of this program lies in laneDetection.py, supporting functions are present in preprocess.py and calibrateCamera.py. <br/>
**data:** Sample data for you to experiment, make sure to replace corresponding file names in main.py with new ones if you are going to use a new footage from your car to detect lanes. <br/>
**data/calibration:** A directory to store chessboard images clicked using the camera you are going to use to collect data.

### Requirements
Python 3 and above, OpenCV 3 or above, NumPy, Matplotlib and MoviePy

### Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the **build** directory in your preferred IDE and begin with main.py
3. Proceed to run.
4. You are free to try my pipeline on your own clips, , if you want to try on your clips then make sure to change the file name with your data in **data** directory.
